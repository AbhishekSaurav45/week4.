![Shoppy](https://i.ibb.co/W6g39w3/image.png)



## Introduction
Usage
-Customizable Themes:

Use the theme switcher component in the sidebar to toggle between light, dark, and custom themes. Customize your own theme colors by selecting from predefined options or entering custom color codes.

-Tables Management:

Navigate to the Tables section in the sidebar menu. Create new tables by specifying the number of rows and columns, and provide a title for each table. Edit existing tables by adding, removing, or modifying rows and columns. Delete tables that are no longer needed from the dashboard.

-Interactive Charts:

Explore the Charts section in the sidebar to view different types of charts available (e.g., line charts, bar charts, pie charts). Interact with charts by zooming in/out, panning across data, and hovering over data points for details. Customize chart settings such as labels, colors, and data ranges for better visualization.

-Calendar Integration:

Manage schedules and events using the Calendar section accessible from the sidebar. Add new events with specific dates, descriptions, and optional reminders. Edit or delete existing events directly from the calendar view. Kanban Board:

Organize tasks and workflows efficiently with the Kanban Board section in the sidebar. Create new tasks by entering task details and assigning them to different stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done). Drag and drop tasks between stages to reflect their current status and track progress visually.

-User Management:

Access the User Management section from the sidebar to manage user accounts and permissions. Add new users by specifying their roles and permissions within the application. Remove user accounts as necessary to maintain access control and security.

-Responsive Design:

Experience seamless navigation and usability across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Responsive layouts adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction.

-Data Persistence:

Utilize local storage to persist user preferences, theme settings, and task data across sessions. Changes made to tables, charts, calendar events, and user management settings are retained locally for continuity.
